# Mars-Rover
The rover is given a command string which contains multiple commands. This string must then be
broken into each individual command and that command then executed. The valid commands are:
F -> Move forward on current heading
B -> Move backwards on current heading
L -> Rotate left by 90 degrees
R -> Rotate right by 90 degrees

______________________________________________________
I implement Java code which get the coordinations of the mars-Rover Using gradle.

● An example command might be FLFFFRFLB
● Once the full command string has been followed, the rover reports it’s current coordinates
and heading in the format (6, 4)
